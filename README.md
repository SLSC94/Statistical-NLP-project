# Statistical-NLP-project
Contains notes/code for an NLP project on Commonsense Reasoning.

The dataset that will be used in this project is CommonsenseQA, which is a carefully curated set of data meant to avoid pitfall such as annotation artifacts. It has been designed to ensure that answers cannot be easily obtained through search queries, which imply that models that do well on this must form some coherent understanding of the natural world. 

The approach that will be employed would use a combination of BERT (Deep Bidirectional Transformers) and GCN (Graph Convolutional Network). Conceptnet would be used to add in contextual knowledge.
